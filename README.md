Auomatic Nonstationary Oscillatory Modelling

This software package includes Julia (v0.62) scripts to model nonstationary
periodic time series. The methods implement reversible-jump MCMC based
algorithms as described in the paper of Hadj-Amar et al. (2019), 
"Bayesian Model Search for Nonstationary Periodic Time Series".
