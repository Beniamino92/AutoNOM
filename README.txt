     * AutoNOM (Automatic Nonstationary Oscillatory Modelling) *


           Julia scripts which implement the methodology for

 "Bayesian Model Search for Nonstationary Periodic Time Series" 
                (2019), Hadj-Amar et al.

==============================================================================



This software package includes Julia scripts to model nonstationary
periodic time series. The methods implement reversible-jump MCMC
algorithms as described in the paper of Hadj-Amar et al. (2019). 


========================================================================
Summary of AutoNOM package contents:
========================================================================


* Main inference script:

 illustrative_example.jl


* Functions and utilities: 

 functions_stationary_model.jl
 functions_non_stationary_model.jl


========================================================================
Setup and Usage Examples
========================================================================


To use AutoNOM in illustrative_example.jl you must first add 
add the directory that contains functions_stationary_model.jl
and functions_stationary_model.jl to path. The example is based
on the Illustrative Example of Section 5.1 in the manuscript.
